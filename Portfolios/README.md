# Portfolio 1
## Analysis of an E-commerce Dataset
This was the first task we undertook. For this task we had to complete tasks such as Removing Missing data from the file (Null Values), investigating the data and creating descriptive statistics. We also had to plot and analyse the data, as well as giving an overall summary of my findings. At the end we had to learn how to detect and remove outliers that affected the skew of the data.
